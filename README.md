Equity factor fund
The choice of signals for the Dynamic Equity Growth Fund is meticulously curated to align with its strategic objectives, focusing on optimizing returns while effectively managing risk. 

ROE: Return on Equity
Return on Equity (ROE) is a crucial financial ratio that measures a company's ability to generate profits from its shareholders' equity. Specifically, ROE is calculated by dividing net income by shareholder equity, thus providing insights into how effectively a company utilizes the money that shareholders have invested. High ROE values typically indicate that a company is efficient at generating profits without needing as much capital, which can signify strong management and a profitable business model. In the context of stock selection, ROE is a valuable indicator for assessing corporate profitability and financial health. Investors often favor companies with higher ROE as they are usually more capable of generating cash internally and thus more likely to deliver solid growth and dividends.

DTV: Daily Trading Volume
Daily Trading Volume (DTV) represents the average number of shares traded in a stock on a given day and is a key indicator of a stock's liquidity. Higher trading volumes often indicate higher liquidity, meaning that shares can be bought or sold in large quantities without a significant impact on the price. For investors, high liquidity is advantageous as it facilitates easier entry and exit from positions in the market at predictable prices. DTV is especially important in risk management, as it affects the ability to execute trades quickly and at desired prices, reducing the cost of trading and the risk of price manipulation.

 R11: Momentum
Momentum (R11) refers to the tendency of stock prices to continue their current trajectory over time. This signal typically measures how much the price of a stock has increased or decreased over a specific period (often the past 12 months, excluding the most recent month to avoid short-term reversals). Stocks exhibiting strong positive momentum (i.e., prices that have been rising consistently) are often expected to continue performing well in the near term, under the assumption that the factors driving their increased valuation will persist. Conversely, stocks with negative momentum may continue to decline. Momentum strategies capitalize on this continuation of price movements, betting on the persistence of trends in market behavior.

Strategic Application in Investment
In an investment strategy, combining these three signals—ROE, DTV, and R11—can provide a balanced approach to selecting stocks. ROE offers a measure of financial efficiency and profitability, DTV ensures that chosen stocks have sufficient liquidity to allow for flexible trading strategies, and R11 helps in capturing trends, adding a dynamic component to the selection process that aligns with current market movements. By integrating these signals, the Dynamic Equity Growth Fund aims to construct a diversified 
portfolio that balances risk and return effectively while targeting sustainable capital growth.

OBJECTIVES:

The main objectives of the Dynamic Equity Growth Fund are strategically designed to maximize investor returns while managing investment risks effectively. Here’s a detailed elaboration on each objective:

1. Capital Appreciation: The primary goal of the fund is to secure long-term growth of capital. This is pursued through strategic investments in high-performing equities identified by rigorous analysis and a robust selection process. The fund targets stocks that not only demonstrate strong historical performance but also hold potential for future growth. This approach ensures that capital appreciation is not merely a by-product of market trends but a result of deliberate, well-informed investment choices that capitalize on both cyclical and secular growth opportunities in various sectors.

2. Risk Management: In pursuit of high returns, the fund does not compromise on risk measures. Recognizing that high-return potentials often come with higher risks, especially in volatile markets, the fund implements prudent risk management practices. This involves diversifying investments across different sectors and geographic regions to mitigate systemic risks and using advanced financial instruments and strategies such as options and futures to hedge against market volatility. Additionally, the fund continuously monitors market conditions and adjusts its risk profile accordingly, ensuring that investor capital is safeguarded against unforeseen market downturns.

3. Outperform Benchmark: The ultimate aim of the fund is to consistently outperform the S&P 500 index on a risk-adjusted basis. This ambitious objective is rooted in the fund’s commitment to delivering superior returns that compensate for any additional risks taken beyond the market average. By leveraging a combination of quantitative and qualitative analyses, the fund identifies undervalued stocks and sectors with significant upside potential that are overlooked by the market. The performance is regularly measured against the S&P 500 to ensure that the fund not only exceeds this benchmark in terms of total returns but also achieves better risk-adjusted returns, making it an attractive option for discerning investors looking for effective wealth accumulation strategies.

Each of these objectives is interconnected, supporting a holistic approach to fund management that strives for growth, safeguards investments, and seeks to establish a track record of exceptional performance. This strategic positioning is crucial for attracting and retaining investors who are keen on achieving superior market returns without exposing themselves to undue risk.







METHODOLOGY

- Quarterly Predictive Signals: Each quarter, the fund compiles and analyzes predictive signals that include beta, share price, trading volume, ROE (Return on Equity), and momentum (R11). These indicators are critical for assessing the potential future performance of stocks.
2. Stock Ranking and Selection
- Initial Ranking: Stocks are ranked based on their market capitalization and trading volume at the end of each quarter. This step helps identify the top 1000 stocks, ensuring that the selections have sufficient market presence and liquidity.
- Further Refinement: From the top 1000, stocks are further ranked according to their ROE and momentum indicators. This refined ranking process pinpoints the top 100 stocks for the Target 100 fund, focusing on high-performing stocks with potential for growth.
3. Performance Calculation and Visualization
-Value-Weighted Returns: The fund calculates the value-weighted average returns based on market capitalization. This approach weights each stock's return by its size within the portfolio, which helps mitigate risk and enhance the impact of larger, more stable companies on the fund’s performance.
- Annual Returns Visualization: A bar plot illustrating the annual returns from 1992 to 2021 for the Target 100 Fund is created to provide a visual assessment of the fund's performance over time.
- Compound Returns Calculation: By aggregating all returns, compound returns are computed, offering a measure of the fund's growth over multiple periods.

 
4. Benchmark Comparison and Advanced Analysis
- Benchmarking: The performance of the Target 100 Fund is compared against a benchmark index to gauge its relative success. Metrics such as average annual return, annual volatility, Sharpe ratio, and compounded returns over various periods (1, 3, 5, 10, and 30 years) are calculated to determine which investment option offers superior performance.

Regression Analysis
Advanced statistical methods, including the CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model) and the Fama-French three-factor model, are utilized to analyze the performance of the Target 100 Fund. These models help isolate the effects of market-wide factors on the fund’s returns, providing insights into the true skill level of the fund managers and the inherent risk factors associated with the investment strategy.



Regression Analysis using CAPM:

- R-squared of 0.819: Indicates that about 82% of the variation in the fund's excess returns can be explained by the market movements, showing a strong model fit.
- Beta of 0.9022: This coefficient suggests that the fund is responsive to market movements but slightly less volatile than the market itself. It moves almost in line with the market but with a slightly reduced intensity.
- Statistical Significance: Both the intercept and MKT coefficients are statistically significant, implying reliable predictions from the model.
- Durbin-Watson statistic of 1.957: Indicates no significant autocorrelation in the residuals, supporting the model's assumptions.
The regression confirms that the fund’s performance is significantly linked to the market, with its returns being somewhat less volatile than the overall market. This indicates a conservative investment strategy relative to the market. The tests for normality (Omnibus and Jarque-Bera) suggest the residuals are not normally distributed, pointing to potential outliers or extreme values that could affect risk assessments. Managers might consider further analysis to identify and mitigate these risks.

This model effectively captures the relationship between market performance and fund returns, confirming the fund's market-driven dynamics while revealing areas for further risk management focus.

The OLS regression results using the Fama-French three-factor model reveal key insights into the performance of the Target 100 fund relative to market and size factors:

### Key Findings:
- **R-squared of 0.850** suggests that 85% of the variability in the fund's excess returns can be explained by the model, indicating a strong fit.
- **Coefficients**: 
  - MKT (0.9321): Shows a strong positive relationship with market movements, meaning the fund performs well when the market does.
  - SMB (-0.2350)and HML (-0.1422): Both have negative impacts on the fund’s returns, indicating underperformance in environments where smaller companies or value stocks outperform.
Statistical Significance:
- All predictors are statistically significant with very low p-values, confirming the reliability of these findings.

Model Diagnostics:
- The Durbin-Watson statistic of 2.076 suggests no problematic autocorrelation.
- Tests like Omnibus and Jarque-Bera indicate non-normality in residuals, which could impact the model's assumptions but doesn’t detract from the model's explanatory power.
The analysis indicates that while the fund is heavily influenced by market trends, it may need to adjust its strategies concerning small and value stocks to enhance performance. This detailed statistical insight aids in strategic portfolio adjustments to better align with market conditions and investor expectations.
